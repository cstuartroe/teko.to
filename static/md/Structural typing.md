A very important concept in Teko, as in many languages with classes or
other sorts of static types, is the notion of **subtyping**. The core idea
is that two types are in a subtyping relationship - that is, type `S` is a
subtype of type `T` if an instance of `S` may be used anywhere a value of
type `T` is required, typically an assignment or a function argument.
