Teko has four basic data types at the moment: `str`, `char`, `int`, and `bool`.

```
s : str = "Hello"
c : char = 'c'
n : int = 5
b : bool = true
```

Strings and chars are unicode-safe, although 
not all escape sequences have been implemented yet.

Integers are arbitrary-precision.

Boolean literals are all-lowercase: `true`, `false`.

Floats are planned for a future release.

Teko also has a unit type `null`, whose only value is `null`.

```
n: null = null
```
