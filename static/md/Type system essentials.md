Teko is a statically typed language, meaning that the type of all variables
and expressions is known before runtime. Teko's typing system is structural,
meaning that the content of a type determines its relationship with other types.
This is in contrast to languages with explicit inheritance and type hierarchies,
such as Python and Java.

The next few lessons walk through the most core features of Teko's type system.
The nature of Teko's structural typing is most easily illustrated by discussion
of object types, so that's where we begin.
