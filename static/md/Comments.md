Teko's comment syntax should be familiar to any user of a language with C-style
syntax. It uses `//` for line comments and `/*`...`*/` for block comments.

```
// This is a line comment.

/* This is
a block comment. */

/* Block comments
   /* can nest */
   in Teko. */

// Try commenting out the line below!
println("Not a comment (yet!)")
---
```
