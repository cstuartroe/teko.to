Welcome to the Teko crash course! This module is to get you familiar with the
structure of the course.

Below you should see a block of code. Try clicking the arrow in the top left
to execute the code. You can also modify the contents and rerun to see what
happens.

```
// Printing in Teko is quite straightforward.
// Try to modify the script to print "Goodbye!"

println("Hello world!")
---
Goodbye!
```

Some of these codeblocks
will challenge you to achieve a particular output; read the comment in this bit of
code and modify the code to get the desired result. Upon rerunning you should see
a notification of your success.

In the left-hand panel you can see the entire sequence of lessons in the course.
Try clicking a lesson title in the left panel to view it, or simply click the
arrow to the right of this text to proceed to the next lesson.

Future lessons will similarly have a back arrow to navigate to the previous lesson.
